  </header>
  <section class="post-body e-content">
	<p>If you don’t know me well, it may not be obvious that collecting records is the perfect hobby for me: it’s expensive, easy to get passionate about, few people care, and yes, it’s fairly pretentious. Record collecting even has dedicated and beloved shops for its adherents, often questionably lit and with entrances on side roads or alleys, a-la used book stores. It’s really got my name written all over it. So it might come as a surprise that I’ve never bothered until recently to be interested in it. You see, I’m not really that into music.</p> <p><strong>But</strong> as it turns out <em>collecting</em> records doesn’t really require that you <em>listen</em> to them. At least, that’s what I’m telling myself as I buy them recently and then proceed to listen to them on Apple Music while I wait for them to arrive.</p> <p>I don’t even have a record player, but I’m up to five records on my shelf and in my <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/calebhearth/collection" rel="me">Discogs account</a>:</p> <ol class="cite-li"> <li class="album u-bookmark-of h-cite" id="album_26567141"> <a class="u-url u-uid" href="https://www.discogs.com/release/26567141"> <img alt="So Much (For) Stardust" title="So Much (For) Stardust" class="u-photo" width="281" src="https://i.discogs.com/ZppzuFgjdblt72V6orwSnzn7rmDVPZDbZbrnly-XBPM/rs:fit/g:sm/q:90/h:600/w:600/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9SLTI2NTY3/MTQxLTE2ODUzODA1/MTEtNjgzMS5qcGVn.jpeg" /> </a> <p class="p-name">So Much (For) Stardust</p> <p class="h-card p-author"> <span class="p-name">Fall Out Boy</span> </p> </li> <li class="album u-bookmark-of h-cite" id="album_28654792"> <a class="u-url u-uid" href="https://www.discogs.com/release/28654792"> <img alt="Electric Mangrove" title="Electric Mangrove" class="u-photo" width="281" src="https://i.discogs.com/QtegN_TEIjjBs64okhLpH2s5ray5-F5_BDB6gc-fjYE/rs:fit/g:sm/q:90/h:603/w:600/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9SLTI4NjU0/NzkyLTE2OTc4Mzgz/ODgtNTU3OC5wbmc.jpeg" /> </a> <p class="p-name">Electric Mangrove</p> <p class="h-card p-author"> <span class="p-name">The Dead Robotz</span> </p> </li> <li class="album u-bookmark-of h-cite" id="album_26974238"> <a class="u-url u-uid" href="https://www.discogs.com/release/26974238"> <img alt="Signs Of Life" title="Signs Of Life" class="u-photo" width="281" src="https://i.discogs.com/Nl4_cH-fdF64GtoQ1dWIo3QX8f411OPPtZXJCEus_P8/rs:fit/g:sm/q:90/h:590/w:600/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9SLTI2OTc0/MjM4LTE2ODMyMTg2/NjYtODE3MS5qcGVn.jpeg" /> </a> <p class="p-name">Signs of Life</p> <p> <span class="h-card p-author p-name">Neil Gaiman</span>...</p></li></ol>

  <section class="post-body e-content">
	<p>I want to share an approach to highlighting and tabbing an adventure that I’ve used recently to prep for RPG night with some success, and have missed when I didn’t have time to do it.</p> <p>Prepping for running an adventure or module means reading and understanding a good amount of text. The standard “house style” that most adventure authors use at least in D&amp;D and the OSR includes boxed text for what’s meant to be read to players and often includes <em>italics</em> and <strong>bold</strong> to call out spells and names, respectively. I find that while these are helpful during the first read, it’s useful for me to have highlighted text and marginalia that I use as study aids when reading the module in advance of running it. For longer texts, I also like to have tabs to navigate.</p> <p>Something about my brain makes it hard for me to do things like this without a system for what colors I should use for what things, so here is the one I’ve devised. I hope it’s useful to you too!</p> <p>Information that will only be useful...</p>

	<p>As a best practice, when you enhance your Rails app’s <code>assets:precompile</code> task to build static assets that can be served faster than if they needed to be compiled at runtime, you should also enhance <code>assets:clobber</code> to remove the artifacts you create.</p> <p>Rails built in precompile task will build assets by running CSS and JavaScript through preprocessors, combine them into a single file (or more, depending on setup), and give them file names with SHA sums.</p> <p>The <code>assets:clobber</code> Rake task is the less well-known sibling of <code>assets:precompile</code>. It’s really useful when you want to be able to verify that your build process works correctly that you can also tear it down completely.

  </header>
  <section class="post-body e-content">
	<blockquote><span class="s1" style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody;">While I understand the visual appeal of a cocktail garnish, from a simple slice of citrus to a more ornamental combination of fruits, leaves, and spices, it’s worth asking: Is the resulting waste&nbsp;</span><span class="s2" style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleItalicBody; font-style: italic;">really</span><span class="s1" style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody;">worth it?</span></blockquote>
<p><span class="s1" style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody;">While I can't claim that I've spent a huge amount of time thinking about the waste (in transportation, water, biomass going to landfill or compost), I have cut back on garnishes for cocktails I make at home, especially when they're just for me. A spritz of absinthe, bitters, or citrus oil over a drink gives a similar effect on scent and flavor. Sure, you lose the visual impact but it's probably worthwhile.</span></p>
<p>Are you in camp "keep the garnish", "leave it out", or "pick an alternative like dehydrated lemon peel in salt rim"?</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body e-content">
	<p>An excellent overview of steps we can take to prevent scraping of content by unscrupulous bots, including options for robots.txt and blocking specific User-Agents at the firewall or CDN level.</p>
<p>As Neil writes, it's a real problem that this is an opt-out situation, meaning that we need to explicity deny access to our copywritten works, rather than opt-in where authors, artists, and creators provide their work for training purposes.</p>
<p>Like many web users, I've played with using tools like ChatGPT for writing blog posts, Dall-E and Midjourney for hallucinating artwork, Copilot for helping write code, and probably some other things I can't recall right now. I also harbor significant concerns about the ethics of how these tools were trained and the consequences of using them.</p>
<p>I suppose that we can at least give credit to these companies for being "well-behaved" if they follow these directives or identify themselves by User-Agent.</p>

  <section class="post-body e-content">
	<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">One of the best articulated arguments against using Tailwind and other CSS-avoidances (for using CSS?). &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">Bemoaning "fixes" by programmers who refuse to take the time to learn CSS and instead, Elaina writes:</span></p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: x-large;">Those “fixes” manifested as CSS-in-JS, Material, Bootstrap, and Tailwind, to name a few. If you peruse web dev Twitter for any length of time, you’ll find the communities that evangelize these frameworks are mainly self-described programmers or developers. Oftentimes, they are used as a panacea to all their CSS woes; simply bolting it onto a project is their one-way ticket to not having to see CSS, let alone writing it.</span></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">Elaina has the intriguing take that this is partially caused by the male-dominated community of developers considering CSS to be feminine and thereby devaluing it as a tool and proficiency with it as secondary.</span></p>

  <section class="post-body e-content">
	<div class="trix-content">
<p>Hannah argues that pregancy apps can better support several categories of user:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who have spent years trying to get and stay pregnant. People who have spent almost as much time recovering from a miscarriage as they have actually being pregnant. People who have ended a very desired pregnancy because of medical conditions for the parent, the fetus, or the baby. People who have given birth to a gorgeous child who didn’t make it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've had several friends who have been outside of the &nbsp;"normal" user category and I fully endorse that apps should support folks who fall outside of this. I can only imagine that it's extremely hard to be in any number of situations where the constant assumption of a healthy child on the part of app developers is just a reminder of loss, unhappiness, or despair.</p>
