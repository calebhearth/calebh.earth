It’s really got my name written all over it. So it might come as a surprise that I’ve never bothered until recently to be interested in it. You see, I’m not really that into music.</p> <p><strong>But</strong> as it turns out <em>collecting</em> records doesn’t really require that you <em>listen</em> to them.

The standard “house style” that most adventure authors use at least in D&amp;D and the OSR includes boxed text for what’s meant to be read to players and often includes <em>italics</em> and <strong>bold</strong> to call out spells and names, respectively. I find that while these are helpful during the first read, it’s useful for me to have highlighted text and marginalia that I use as study aids when reading the module in advance of running it. For longer texts, I also like to have tabs to navigate.</p> <p>Something about my brain makes it hard for me to do things like this without a system for what colors I should use for what things, so here is the one I’ve devised.
