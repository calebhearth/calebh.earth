These attributes can, in turn, be used to create Kanban-style boards. I mostly use a board whose columns are controlled my custom “Status” property and which is set to automatically sort each column by oldest to most recent update. You can also control what shows up on the cards. I have it set up to show Name, the list of Tags I’ve assigned, and the Excerpt.

The standard “house style” that most adventure authors use at least in D&amp;D and the OSR includes boxed text for what’s meant to be read to players and often includes <em>italics</em> and <strong>bold</strong> to call out spells and names, respectively. I find that while these are helpful during the first read, it’s useful for me to have highlighted text and marginalia that I use as study aids when reading the module in advance of running it. For longer texts, I also like to have tabs to navigate.</p> <p>Something about my brain makes it hard for me to do things like this without a system for what colors I should use for what things, so here is the one I’ve devised. I hope it’s useful to you too!</p> <p>Information that will only be useful...</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://calebhearth.com/a/annotating-ttrpg-modules\">Read More</a></p>\n",
